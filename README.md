# cppmidi
This is a library to parse and save MIDI files. It's supposed to be a lightweight straight forward and easy to use library.
The goal is oo provide a very basic MIDI parsing/saving library without a lot of features with the intention to make it very easy to use
and without having to dig through pages of documentation.

At the moment, documentation is not yet available, but there are example programs in `examples` which may be helpful if you have not used this library before.

THIS LIBRARY CANNOT DO MIDI PORT I/O. It's useful only for parsing and saving MIDI files.
