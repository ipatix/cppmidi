# cppmidi
This is a library to parse and save MIDI files. It's supposed to be a lightweight straight forward and easy to use library.
The goal is the same as my "csmidi" library: To provide a very basic MIDI parsing/saving library without a lot of features with the intention to make it very easy to use without documentation.

In it's current state I didn't really do a lot of testing yet and it therefore there will probably be a few bugs I'm not aware of.

THIS LIBRARY CANNOT DO MIDI PORT I/O. It's useful only for parsing and saving MIDI files.
